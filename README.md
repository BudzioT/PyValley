# PyValley
## :computer: Info
PyValley, a little cozy game in which you just... relax<br><br>
It's got health mechanics, so farm quickly, to not starve!<br>
Also please don't step on plants, when they grow... they too have feelings<br><br>
It is written in Python with PyGame as the main engine and deployed with pyinstaller<br>

## :hammer: How to build the project
You can use the app without building by going into <b>dist/main</b> and using .exe generated by pyinstaller!<br>
If you want to build it yourself:
- Download PyGame
- Compile the main.py file, compiling other without it doesn't result in anything
